# Non-Zero-Sum Stochastic Games in Derivative Pricing

## Overview

This project explores the use of non-zero-sum stochastic games for derivative pricing. By incorporating game theory and stochastic processes, it models the strategic interactions between multiple market participants, offering a more dynamic approach compared to traditional pricing models. The goal is to capture how traders' competitive and cooperative behavior impacts pricing mechanisms.

## Key Concepts

**Non-Zero-Sum Games**: Games where players' outcomes are not strictly opposites, reflecting real-world financial markets.
**Nash Equilibrium**: A strategy profile where no player benefits from changing their strategy, used to predict trader behavior.
**Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)**: Used to determine optimal strategies for traders by iteratively adjusting based on market rewards.

## Objectives

1. Model strategic interactions between traders for more realistic derivative pricing.
2. Apply game theory and reinforcement learning to optimize pricing strategies and compute Nash Equilibria.
3. Explore how non-zero-sum game models improve upon traditional, risk-neutral pricing methods.
